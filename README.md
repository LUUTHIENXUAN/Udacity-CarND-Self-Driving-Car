## Table of Contents

#### [P1 - Detecting Lane Lines (basic)](project_1_lane_finding_basic)
 - **Summary:** Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used OpencV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision
 
#### [P2 - Traffic Sign Classification](project_2_traffic_sign_classifier)
 - **Summary:** Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.
 - **Keywords:** Deep Learning, TensorFlow, Computer Vision
 
#### [P3 - Behavioral Cloning](project_3_behavioral_cloning)
 - **Summary:** Built and trained a convolutional neural network for end-to-end driving in a simulator, using TensorFlow and Keras. Used optimization techniques such as regularization and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks.
 - **Keywords:** Deep Learning, Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks

#### [P4 - Advanced Lane Finding](project_4_advanced_lane_finding)
 - **Summary:** Built an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision, OpenCV
 
#### [P5 - Vehicle Detection and Tracking](project_5_vehicle_detection)
 - **Summary:** Created a vehicle detection and tracking pipeline with OpenCV, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and support vector machines (SVM). Implemented the same pipeline using a deep network to perform detection. Optimized and evaluated the model on video data from a automotive camera taken during highway driving.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision, Deep Learning, OpenCV
