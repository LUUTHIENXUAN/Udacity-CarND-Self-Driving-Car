## Table of Contents

#### [P01 - Finding Lane Lines on the Road](https://github.com/LUUTHIENXUAN/Udacity-CarND-Self-Driving-Car/tree/master/Udacity-CarND-P01-LaneLines)
 - **Summary:** Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used OpencV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision
 - **Comment from Udacity reviewer:** [LINK](https://review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/851338/shared) 
 
#### [P02 - Traffic Sign Classifier](https://github.com/LUUTHIENXUAN/Udacity-CarND-Self-Driving-Car/tree/master/Udacity-CarND-P02-Traffic-Sign-Classifier)
 - **Summary:** Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.
 - **Keywords:** Deep Learning, TensorFlow, Computer Vision
 - **Comment from Udacity reviewer:** [LINK](https://review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/911777/shared)
 
#### [P03 - Behavioral Cloning](https://github.com/LUUTHIENXUAN/Udacity-CarND-Self-Driving-Car/tree/master/Udacity-CarND-P03-Behavioral-Cloning)
 - **Summary:** Built and trained a convolutional neural network for end-to-end driving in a simulator, using TensorFlow and Keras. Used optimization techniques such as regularization and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks.
 - **Keywords:** Deep Learning, Keras, Convolutional Neural Networks
 - **Comment from Udacity reviewer:** [LINK](https://review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/969487/shared)
 
#### [P04 - Advanced Lane Finding](https://github.com/LUUTHIENXUAN/Udacity-CarND-Self-Driving-Car/tree/master/Udacity-CarND-P04-Advanced-Lane-Lines)
 - **Summary:** Built an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision, OpenCV
 - **Comment from Udacity reviewer:** [LINK](https://review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/1011619/shared)

#### [P05 - Vehicle Detection and Tracking](https://github.com/LUUTHIENXUAN/Udacity-CarND-Self-Driving-Car/tree/master/Udacity-CarND-P05-Vehicle-Detection)
 - **Summary:** Created a vehicle detection and tracking pipeline with OpenCV, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and support vector machines (SVM). Implemented the same pipeline using a deep network to perform detection. Optimized and evaluated the model on video data from a automotive camera taken during highway driving.
 - **Keywords:** Computer Vision, Deep Learning, OpenCV
